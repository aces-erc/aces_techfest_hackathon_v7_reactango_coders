# ACES Techfest Hackathon v7.0

Team: Reactango Coders

Rule Book [see here!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sa2UTJ7J4sWB28mvU9a0f6jQxJQ7z5AI/view?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR1QW9FOv_LZ5pnDR0sxwzTpC2i9I1_Lhjd_HcXlwCW5c4tkOeJeAV0SWTE_aem_Q-iRzE-UhY2m2F2XHkB6vg)

## Things to consider:
- Participants are *not allowed* to bring pre-existing or ready-made projects. All work must be initiated and developed during the hackathon. (We will regularly check the codebase.)
- If any irregularities are found during the checking, it will lead to the team's *disqualification*.
- Participants are encouraged to collaborate *not only within their teams* but also with mentors and organizers for guidance.
- Every team must make at least *one commit every 6 hours* on the given repository.
- All the code must be pushed to the given repository.
- *Only make useful commits.* Do not make random or unnecessary commits. Commits should be meaningful and relevant.
- *First Commit:* One commit is already done by ACES while creating the repository. Your first commit should be made after the event has started, with the message: first commit: [commit message].
- *Last Commit:* Do the final commit after the event is completed with the message: last commit: [commit message].
- Any team who commits after the *last commit tag* will be *disqualified*.
- After the *last commit, you are allowed to commit **only once* to upload your presentation to the repository with the message: upload presentation.

## Code Quality and Documentation:
- All code must be *well-documented*. Use meaningful comments to explain the purpose of functions, algorithms, and critical sections of the code.
- Follow *best practices* for code structure, naming conventions, and readability.
- Avoid *code duplication*. Write clean and maintainable code.
- Ensure that your code follows standard coding guidelines for your chosen language and framework.

## Team Conduct and Behavior:
- Teams must behave *respectfully* towards all participants, mentors, and organizers.
- Any form of *harassment, **discrimination, or **inappropriate behavior* will lead to immediate disqualification.
- Teams should collaborate effectively, ensuring each member contributes positively to the project.
- Professionalism is expected in all communications during the event.

## Mentor Assistance:
- Mentors will be available to provide *guidance* and *advice* on technical issues, debugging, and project development.
- *Mentors are not allowed to code on behalf of any team* or make decisions for the team.
- Teams can ask for advice on *best practices, **problem-solving techniques, or **design decisions*, but they must develop the project independently.

## Submission Guidelines:
- Submit your final project by uploading the presentation and project files to the repository.
- Include a *README* file explaining the project, its features, and how to run it.
- Your final commit should include any *demo materials* or additional files required for judges to evaluate your project.
- Ensure all documentation is complete and the project is functional before submitting.

## Judging Criteria:
Will be informed before the event.
